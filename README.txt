=============LICENSING =============

Blah blah, This is property of The Trade Services Department at Gallant Capital Markets, FX.  
It is NOT distributed under any F/OSS licensing.  You want it, send us money.

We contribute lots of stuff to FOSS projects.  This is not one of them.

It will be sold as is and you will be forbidden from ever using it in anything commercial or F/OSS related ever.  :D

If you don't work for GCM's TS department, This is irrelevant to anything you do in life.  Go away.

Basically, imagine the most restrictive apple license ever.  Now make it worse.

Good.  You have no rights to this code.  

Cool. ::::)
